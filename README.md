# Predicting-Coronary-Heart-Disease
Coronary heart diseases/coronary artery diseases (CHDs/CAD), the most common form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), are a major cause for death and disability in developing/developed countries. Although CAD mortality rates have dropped over the past four decades, CAD remains responsible for about one-third of all deaths in people over age 35.

My group predicted whether there is less chance or more chance of heart disease by exploring different Data Mining techniques like logistic regression, classification trees, and neural networks. We employed various algorithms and choose the model which gives the best prediction results by comparing the accuracy measures to avoid overfitting.
