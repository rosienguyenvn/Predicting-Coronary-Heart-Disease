# Predicting-Coronary-Heart-Disease
We predicted whether there is less chance or more chance of heart disease by exploring different Data Mining techniques like logistic regression, classification trees, and neural networks. We employed various algorithms and choose the model which gives the best prediction results by comparing the accuracy measures to avoid overfitting.
